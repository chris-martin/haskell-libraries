synopsis: >
  A simple multi-way tree data structure.

description: >
  In some contexts, forests (collections of zero or more trees) are more
  important than trees. The /data-forest/ library provides a @Tree@ type much
  like the one from the popular /containers/ library, but it also provides a
  @Forest@ type with its own @Functor@ and @Foldable@ instances.
