# haskell-libraries

This repository is a convenient place for me to start libraries. If a package grows into anything significant, I'll split it out into its own repository. If you find something here that you want to use that isn't on Hackage, submit an issue.

Packages released to Hackage:
[data-forest](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-forest)
[human-parse](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/human-parse),
[human-text](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/human-text),
[loc](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/loc),
[loc-test](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/loc-test).
