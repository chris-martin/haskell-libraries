# haskell-libraries

This repository is a convenient place for me to start libraries. If a package grows into anything significant, I'll split it out into its own repository. If you find something here that you want to use that isn't on Hackage, submit an issue.

There are some packages that don't compile, but these are not listed in `stack.yaml`. So you should be able to run `stack test` to check everything that *is* supposed to be in working condition.
